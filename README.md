## Important Notice

AutoMuteUs Portable is now planning to have a major update from v3 to v4. This update contains a huge architecture change so that AutoMuteUs Portable below v3.1.0 will not work since the upcoming release of v4.

## What is this?

This is portable version of [AutoMuteUs(self-hosting)](https://github.com/automuteus). So that no need to install anything.

Note that this is not AmongUsCapture. this is its server side ‚úä

## Update Information

I'll be posting updates on [Twitter(@DYZdK2oir7Pm)](https://twitter.com/DYZdK2oir7Pm) as they become available. Please follow me.

Also, please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or problems.

Please note that all posts are in Japanese.

## Caution

I found a bug that AutoMuteUs Portable won't initialize Postgres database so that AutoMuteUs won't store player stats properly.

I fixed in v2.2.5. So please use later than v2.2.5.

I recommend you to initialize your Postgres again.
